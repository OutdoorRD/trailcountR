Description: Forest and trail monitoring programs employ various counting methods 
	to estimate the visitors to a site. These raw formats with instantaneous or 
	hourly counts must be transformed into daily counts to be used in downstream 
	analyses. This package provides function for working with various onsite 
	counters such as TRAFx Infrared, manual parking lot counts, magnetic vehicle
	counts etc.
